## Simple code to make trading decisions using SMA
In this project we use the simple moving average to make decisions on to buy or sell an asset.
A Simple moving average is simple the average on a fixed number a days. In the program, i have considered a 20 day, 50 day and a 200 day period.
An SMA can be used to assess a trend. I have used Bitcoin (USD) prices to demonstrate the SMA. I have imported the data using the coinbase api. You can import pricing data from any source according to the assest you want to study.
using this data i have plotted a graph for a final visual understanding. An upward curve indicates a bullish trend or a buy signal. A downward curve indicates a bearish trend or a sell signal.
